# MyFirstGodotProject
My first game using godot, using the freecodecamp tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8lMTwSRoRg. 

You are a young adventurer exploring a mystical world. Slimes and frogs roam the lands.
Your mission: survive, collect treasure, and grow stronger with every battle. 
* Use arrow keys or WASD to move
* Gain gold by jumping on enemies, and collecting cherrys
* Touch a mob, i double dog dare you _they'll explode on impact_

## Process

When I first opened Godot, the node system felt confusing, like wandering through a maze. By the end of the tutorial, I could make my character jump, attack, and even save progress - it felt like I had unlocked a whole new world.

## in the video i learnt:
- how to create my first 2D scene and understanding godot’s node‑based structure
- animating a player character, including movement and jumping
- designing enemies and giving them simple AI behaviors
- working with tilemaps to build levels
- adding UI elements, such as gold counters or health
- Game auto-saves _(so ppl have more to complain about )_
basically the foundation of the godot engine

## what i added: _(that the video did not include)_
- advanced death handling
- advanced animated background
- added 1 extra mob (slime)
- added ladder detection
- Levelling system with an exponentional growth:
  - _(you wont get too stacked, ill make sure of that [next update... increase rates and lower max hp rates trust trust 💔])_
  - **gold purchases:** ×1.15 per level
  - **max hp:** ×1.1 per level
- Death Counter _(because I am counting your pain)_

## Future 
next time in ~~dragon ball z~~ _(wait wrong anime)_:
- add music _(so it stops being silent despair)_
- making enemy scripts more modular
- add more mobs _(frogs and slimes are lonely [you wont guess what they've been doing at 3 am])_
- added ladder detection
- more maps (such as a mine)
- boss
- add an inventory system/gui
- mobile support???
- suggest more... (will be open to further )
