# MyFirstGodotProject
My first game using godot, using the freecodecamp tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8lMTwSRoRg. 

## in the video i learnt:
- how to create my first 2D scene and understanding godot’s node‑based structure
- animating a player character, including movement and jumping
- designing enemies and giving them simple AI behaviors
- working with tilemaps to build levels
- adding UI elements, such as gold counters or health
- implementing save/load features to persist game progress
basically the foundation of the godot engine

## what i added: _(that the video did not include)_
- advanced death handling
- added 1 extra mob (slime)
- added ladder detection
- added levelling system with an exponentional rate:
  - **gold purchases:** ×1.15 per level
  - **max hp:** ×1.1 per level
- added death counter

## Future 
- add music
- making enemy scripts more modular
- add more mobs
- added ladder detection
- more maps (such as a mine)
- boss
- add an inventory system/gui
- suggest more... (will be open)
